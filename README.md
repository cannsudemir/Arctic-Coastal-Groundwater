Description: Values are given for the upward discharge estimated for 100 different hydraulic conductivity (HK) scenarios and integrated over the top boundary of the model domain. They were calculated with the "Line Integration" tool in COMSOL\'ae software, with the expression "dl2.v*(dl2.v>0)" and unit of m\super 3\nosupersub  day\super -1\nosupersub  m\super -1\nosupersub  (dl2.v is in m day\super -1\nosupersub ). It was then multiplied by 1000 m km\super -1\nosupersub  to get a unit of m\super 3\nosupersub  day\super -1\nosupersub  km\super -1\nosupersub .\

\
Vertical groundwater flux (m/d) estimated via FLUX-LM (Kurylyk, B. L. et al. (2017)): Flux for each timestep of temperature-depth measurement is calculated assuming steady-state temperature-depth profile at each time step and a uni-layer system. This approach is not meant to estimate transient fluxes, rather is to give an idea about daily averages. Therefore, results in the main text were not reported as time series, instead, they were given as daily averages. Fluxes along the transects estimated in m/d were then integrated over the seepage length to find the total fresh groundwater discharge. See Methods and the SI of the article for details.\

COMSOL_model_files\
--------\
\
The list of files given in this folder are to reproduce groundwater flux estimates via numerical models. COMSOL files (.mph) are provided for each model domain (SL and KL). initcond_1 and inittemp_1 .txt files are the steady-state concentration and temperature distributions which were previously calculated and are defined in the models as an initial state to run the scenarios.\
\
ERT_data\
--------\
\
In this folder, all the raw ERT survey data (apparent resistivity, pre-inversion) for each transect surveyed are given for reproducibility. \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
